# Deep Feed Forward Neural Networks
In this task you are suppose to develop a deep feed forward neural network using a high level library, e.g. Keras. You should test diﬀerent network structures. You need to register a Kaggle account. 

###

	• Download the ECG database https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bobski/data/data.html
	• Predict the 2 classes: Normal and abnormal. 
	• You need ﬁx the input size to the data.
	  One option is to include only the ﬁrst 75 measurements and either remove
	  any recordings below 75 or pad with 0s or averages. 
	• Hint: Start with a subset of the dataset 
	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions
