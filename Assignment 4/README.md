# Support Vector Machine
In this task you are suppose to implement several types of support vector machines using a Python library. The classiﬁcation should be about Abalone sex. 

	• Download the Abalone dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone 
	• Predict the three classes: Male, Female and Infant
	• Try linear-, polynomial-, Gaussian-, and other kernels. Which works best and why? 
	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions.
