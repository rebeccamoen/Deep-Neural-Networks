# Neural Networks
In this task you are suppose to implement 2 types of mulilayer Perceptrons:
	1. Using only Python.
	2. Using a high level library 

	• Download the Ecoli dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli 
	• Predict the two classes: cp and im (remove the rest of the dataset). 
	• Make the necessary adjustments to the data. 
	• Implement and test a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch using only Python and standard libraries. 
	• Implement and test a Multilayer Perceptron using a high level library (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, Torch). 
	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions.
