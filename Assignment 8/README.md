# Recurrent Neural Networks
In this task you are suppose to implement a chatbot in two ways:

	1. As a classiﬁer
	2. As generator

###

	• Download the Python Questions from Stack Overﬂow dataset https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/pythonquestions 
	• Make the chatbot so that you classify a category (i.e., tag) of input text,
 	  and return a dialog from the correct class.
 	  Note that one question could have multiple tags and you may need to simplify.
	• Alternatively, make a sequence to sequence network that automatically learns what to respond.
 	  It can be character based or word based.
	• Hint: Start with a subset of the dataset 
 	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions.
