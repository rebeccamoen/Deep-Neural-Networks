# Random Forest
In this task you are suppose to implement 2 types of decision trees:

	1. Using only Python.
	2. Using random forest with a library such as sklearn.
  
The classiﬁcation should be to predict recurrent cancer. 

	• Download the Breast Cancer dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer/breast-cancer.data 
	• Predict the two classes: Not-recurrent and recurrent
	• Implement and test a decision tree from scratch using Python and standard libraries. 
	• Implement and test random forest with a library such as sklearn. 
	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions.
