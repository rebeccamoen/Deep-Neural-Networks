# Convolutional Neural Networks
In this task you are suppose to implement a convolutional neural network using a high level library, e.g. Keras. The classiﬁcation should be about food. 

###

	• Download the food 11 dataset https://mmspg.epfl.ch/food-image-datasets 
	  or https://www.kaggle.com/vermaavi/food11/data 
	• Predict the 11 classes: Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food,
	  Meat, Noodles/Pasta, Rice, Seafood, Soup, and Vegetable/Fruit 
	• Try some standard networks convolutional networks before more complex ones. 
	• Hint: Start with a subset of the dataset 
	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions.
