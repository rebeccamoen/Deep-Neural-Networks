# Deep Autoencoders
In this task you are suppose to implement an autoencoder removing systematic noise. Some cameras add a date stamp to images. You should add systematic noise in form of date stamps on images and use autoencoders to remove these time stamps. 

###

	• Download the food 11 dataset https://mmspg.epfl.ch/food-image-datasets (same data set as earlier) 
	• Manually add date stamps (e.g. August 17, 2020) on the images using any Python library you prefer. 
	• Train an autoencoder to avoid the date stamp.
	  As an example, if an image has the text “August 17, 2020” on it,
	  the autoencoder should be able to accurately remove the text. 
	• Hint: Start with a subset of the dataset 
	• Choose the network architecture with care. 
	• Train and validate all algorithms. 
	• Make the necessary assumptions.
